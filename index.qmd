HCC\'s SACSCOC 5th-Year Interim Report is due **September 8, 2024**.

Welcome to Haywood Community College, where we believe education changes
everything. We have many diverse programs to provide each student the
opportunity to work toward a degree; enhance academic and job skills;
enter the workforce; or enjoy a course of interest. Our goal is to
provide accessible, affordable, and high-quality education, workforce
training, and lifelong learning. We are here to provide each student
with the information they need to make decisions that will enable them
to achieve their goals and realize their dreams.
